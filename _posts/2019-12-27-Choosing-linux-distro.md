When any buddy wants to enter into the world of Linux Ocean. One of the hardest questions that every Linux user must answer is, which Linux distribution they should  use. Following three are most popular Linux distributions.

## Ubuntu
One of the most popular general-use distributions with one of the largest selections of software. I am looking great future in Ubuntu because of canonical en-though and community's trust. Ubuntu uses the Unity Desktop as its default desktop environment. According to online surveys, Ubuntu is the most popular Linux distribution on desktop/laptop personal computers and most Ubuntu coverage focuses on its use in that market.

I will recommend Ubuntu for you, if you  are moderate computer user and doing browsing, mails, office work, programming  etc. on your laptop/desktop. You will get lots of software from Ubuntu software center regarding your work.

## Linux Mint 
Linux Mint is a Linux distribution for desktop computers, based on Ubuntu or Debian. Linux Mint is aimed at being a "modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use. It looks similar to windows operating system so,  very good for beginners. Mint provides full out-of-the-box multimedia support by including some proprietary software such as Java and the Adobe Flash which not included in Ubuntu.

I will recommend Linux Mint for you. if you are beginner to Linux and enjoys comfort of Microsoft Windows Operating system, then Mint is best choice for you.

## Fedora
Fedora Core, is an RPM-based, general purpose collection of software, including an operating system based on the Linux kernel, developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and owned by Red Hat.

I will recommend Fedora for you. If you are office user and working on Red Hat or Cent OS servers at your office.

## Conclusion:
People  like me can be nice and make recommendations instead of telling you that you have to use the most popular distribution, but at the end of the day itâ€™s still your choice because all are free. I have tried most of Linux Distros and using Ubuntu on my Laptop and Linux Mint on my desktop.

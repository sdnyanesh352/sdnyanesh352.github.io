The recent news of Mozilla laying off its employees has put a question mark on large portion of the community and a lot of posts asking about alternatives to Firefox have popped up.

I want to tell those people to keep using Firefox.

It is true that the position of Mozilla is not very good but the Firefox browser is still the best option out there. If you people start to abandon this lone ranger, it will just lower the market share even more. The only way to save Firefox is by using it and encouraging it.

^TOR Browser is based on Firefox and if Firefox dies, so does TOR browser. I am sure you all don't want that.

I feel the only hope for Firefox is the privacy community and it should work in the interest of it. We can't let chromium be 100% of the market.

The bottom line is, encourage the use of Firefox. Also we need to have a close eye on its development from now on.

A lot of people here are telling that they don't like something or the other about Firefox and that's why they choose chromium over it. I agree with you that if you don't like something, you don't have to use it. But again i fear, if tomorrow Firefox is dead and Google makes a controversial change in chromium. What will you choose? People who track chromium know that Google has been trying to push stuff like the URL bar thing, etc etc. Today it listens to the community because an alternative exists, tomorrow when there is no alternative, they won't have this fear.

###Firefox can be community driven - 
Well, it is true that Firefox can be taken by the community, but the browsers have become complicated over the years. Also not every computer can build Firefox( took 12+ hours to build on laptop). We need a big player in the community who can contribute when serious vulnerabilities come up. Linux kernel survives this way because players like Intel, AMD, Amazon etc etc contribute thousands of lines of code everyday. Critical software needs dedicated developers. It will be a hard project to maintain.

Some have rightly pointed the layoffs of critical security members of Mozilla. That maybe right. But it is not enough to just make the switch. We need to observe the development and response of Mozilla and then make decisions. This whole layoff thing has triggered a lot of people to look for alternatives. We need to wait and watch closely

In this post I am going show you how to use android phone as a modem to access internet in your Ubuntu/Linux mint machine. Generally we use some tethering apps just like Easy Tether or PDANet, but these apps have limited functionality for free version. for example Easy Tether do not allow to access HTTPS sites in free version.

If go through my way you don't need any android app, It not necessary to install drives software.

Do following settings on your machine.
  1. Connect your android phone to PC via USB cable.
  2. Click on Ubuntu dash => Network Connections => Mobile Broadband.
  3. Click on Add button, it will show you popup window New Mobile Broadband connection.
  4. Click on continue Choose Your Provider's Country or Region.
  5. Choose Your Provider eg. TATA DOCOMO, APN will automatically come.
  6. Confirm Mobile broadband settings and click on Apply button.
  
You have already connected phone to PC do following settings in phone.
  1. Settings => Wireless & Network => Enable Internet tethering option
  2. You are now ready for internet surfing
